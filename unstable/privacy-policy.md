# A Note About Privacy (Privacy Policy):
Terra prompts you to choose a username when you first connect. Additionally, Terra supports (optionally) connecting with your Google account in order to save to your Google Drive.

All of this account data is saved only locally, within your browser. None of it is ever sent by Terra to other users, or to any private servers.

Your Terra "account" is more accurately described as an "identity". Specifically, it is a cryptographic key that is generated once when you choose a username, which is then saved (only) locally. Terra uses this key to confirm with other users that you are who you claim when you connect. Because of this, multiple users can have the same username, but anybody hosting a lobby will know if an imposter attempts to connect.

No additional information is tracked, and no analytics are performed on the users of Terra.
